"""
Appointment Service for Citizen-First Flow.

This service handles the NEW workflow where citizens:
1. Select a location (Malabo or Bata) BEFORE payment
2. Select from available appointment slots BEFORE payment
3. Slot is temporarily held during payment (15 min)
4. Hold is confirmed after payment success
5. Fallback: submit without appointment if no slots available

Different from AppointmentSchedulerService which handles automatic scheduling
by agents AFTER validation.

Flow:
    DRAFT → DOCUMENTS → REVIEW → SELECT_LOCATION → SELECT_SLOT → PAYMENT → SUBMITTED
