"""
Treasury Reconciliation Service — Automated matching of bank transactions to payments.

Scoring algorithm (SQL LATERAL JOIN, O(n * log(m)) with indexes):
- 100 pts: Exact reference match (bank_reference == payment_reference)
-  80 pts: Exact amount match (same amount, same currency)
-  60 pts: Amount ±1% AND same day
-  40 pts: Amount ±1% AND ±3 days, OR Amount ±5% AND ±3 days

Returns top 3 candidates per unreconciled bank transaction, sorted by score.
Auto-match threshold: >= 80 pts (configurable).

Indexes used:
- idx_bank_transactions_unreconciled (bank_transaction_date DESC) WHERE status = 'unreconciled'
- idx_service_payments_reconciliation (currency, workflow_status, validated_at DESC) WHERE workflow_status = 'completed'
- idx_bank_transactions_service_payment_id (service_payment_id) WHERE NOT NULL
