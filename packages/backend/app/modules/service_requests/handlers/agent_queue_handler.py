"""
Agent Queue Event Handler
=========================
Handles events related to payment completion and adds service requests
to the agent work queue for processing.

Business Logic:
- When a payment is COMPLETED (either via electronic payment or Treasury validation),
  the corresponding service_request should be added to agent_work_queue
- This ensures agents only see requests that have been PAID
- The agent can then process the dossier (validate documents, schedule appointments, etc.)
- After assignment, status transitions from PAID → SUBMITTED (visible in agent dashboard)
