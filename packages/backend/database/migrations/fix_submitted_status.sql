-- ============================================================================
-- FIX: Reset incorrectly SUBMITTED service requests to DRAFT
-- ============================================================================
-- This migration corrects requests that were set to SUBMITTED prematurely
-- by the old _check_completion() logic that auto-submitted when all documents
-- were uploaded, without verifying that all wizard steps were completed.
--
-- Criteria for resetting to DRAFT:
-- 1. Status is SUBMITTED
-- 2. submitted_at is NULL (didn't go through proper submission flow)
-- 3. OR form_data is incomplete (missing required wizard fields)
-- ============================================================================

-- First, let's see what we're about to fix
